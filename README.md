# LibreLaw - A Free Database of Legal Materials
## Visit the website at: www.librelaw.com

Welcome to LibreLaw.  Our goal is to support research and analysis of legal materials using open-source natural language processing tools.  We believe that these materials form a large, well-organized, semantically consistent corpus with important commercial and public interest applications.

This repository contains some of the source-code that supports the website.  Specifically, you can find the scripts that:

 - Download raw opinions, statutes, and court rules 
 - Process and parse the raw text or PDFs so they can be stored as tabular data with defined dates, courts, jurisdictions, and other fields.
 - Analyze the corpus for connections between documents and build data structures that support the graphical CiteView featured on the website.

We are always striving to improve our code and its documentation, and welcome all comments.
